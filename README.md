# Phrase-Hunter Game
### Project 4, Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree Program

Attention Treehouse: Extra Credit features included:
- I added logic to avoid repeated phrases until each phrase has been used.
- I added keyboard input in addition to the onscreen keyboard.
- I included support for punctuation/special characters, which are now displayed along with spaces. 
- I added diagonal linear gradient background images to the overlay using CSS.
- I added animation to the PHRASE HUNTER title and header when the user hovers over them, just for fun.
- The start button grows when you hover over it.
- When the user clicks on the start button, the title and message text animate and disappear before game starts.
- Onscreen keyboard keys rotate on hover. alternating keys rotate in different directions
- Onscreen keyboard keys temporarily grow bigger when a correct letter is clicked
- Onscreen keyboard keys temporarily shrink when an incorrect letter is clicked

This project presents a one-player hangman-like game using object-oriented, unobtrusive JavaScript. 
We select a random phrase, then the player guesses letters by pressing keys on either the keyboard 
or the onscreen keyboard. The game ends when the player guesses the complete phrase or when they make 
five incorrect guesses.
